# Indestructible Tools

Hi! Welcome to the source repository of my very first Minecraft modification. I play the game very frequently, and there are some things missing.

One of them is the possibility to create completely indestructible tools like pickaxe, axe, ...
The 'Mending' enchantment isn't enough for me. So I created a mod that adds such tools! Just create some **Indestructible Ingot** by using a diamond, a netherite ingot and an iron ingot and use them to create your pickaxe, axe, hoe, sword and shovel.



### Using in modpacks
You can use this mod in every modpack that is available for free. You are allowed to distribute the mod file in an own ModPack launcher.
Just add a link to this repository or the corresponding CurseForge page.
