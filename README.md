Hi! Welcome to the source repository of my very first Minecraft modification. I play the game very frequently, and there are some things missing.

One of them is the possibility to create completely indestructible tools like pickaxe, axe, ...
The 'Mending' enchantment isn't enough for me. So I created a mod that adds such tools! Just create some **Indestructible Ingot** by using a diamond, a netherite ingot and an iron ingot and use them to create your pickaxe, axe, hoe, sword and shovel.


## Recipes
To craft the ingot, use the following shapeless recipe:\

With these ingots, you are able to craft the known tools by using the known patterns:\

## Multi-Tool
From **Version 2022.1**, this modification contains a multi-tool. It combines the capabilities of the pickaxe, the shovel and the axe. You can craft it by using the following recipe:\

Thanks to [Fundryi](https://github.com/Fundryi) for the [Multi-Tool suggestion](https://github.com/florian-berger/indestructible-tools/issues/4)!

## Usage in modpacks
You can use this mod in every modpack that is available for free. You are allowed to distribute the mod file in an own ModPack launcher.\
If the modpack is not distributed via CurseForge, you need to add a link to this repository, [my website](https://berger-media.biz/downloads/10/minecraft/indestructible-tools) or the [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/indestructible-tools) of this modification.
